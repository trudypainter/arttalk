This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

To run server

```
npm run dev
```

To check out database (using prisma + planet scale)

```
npx prisma studio
```

If you make changes to the schema, run the following command to update the schema online

```
npx prisma db push
```

---

You will need a `.env` file that has a `DATABASE_URL` value. We used [Planet Scale](https://planetscale.com/) for our database.
