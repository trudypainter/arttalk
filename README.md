# Instructions to run code

```
npm run dev
```

b) Instructions for setting up and running your code, making careful note of what’s needed
to get it running on a bare machine (e.g., one with just the appropriate OS). This too is a
useful skill – it’s quite frustrating to get a program that’s advertised as requiring a certain
foundation and then discover a few hours into trying to make it work that the author
forgot to mention something crucial (e.g., it runs in Python 2.7, not 3.5). So think
carefully about the infrastructure your application needs, and list all of it.
