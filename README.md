# Instructions to run code (Created using node v18.12.1 on MacOS)

If you would prefer to run ArtTalk locally, follow these instructions.

First, you need to put the `.env` file in the main directory. Its location is listed in the table of contents.
This file will be emailed separately, as it is insecure to host on GitHub.

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Please use on Google Chrome, and make sure camera and microphone access is enabled.
